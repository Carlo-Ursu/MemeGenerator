# Tech stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## React Hooks and Libraries

In addition to React, I also used various React hooks and libraries, including:

- useState
- useEffect
- htmlcanvas

By using these technologies and libraries, I was able to create a functional and meme generating website. I hope you enjoy creating your own memes!

Welcome to **Meme generator**! This is a meme generating page where you can create your own memes, based on a set of different meme images and then download them on your device.

## Getting Started

At first the page loads up and the user has to insert the desired text to be displayed on the meme. Also, the user can choose from a variety of meme image ideas.

## Download feature

Using the htmlCanvas, I made it easier for the user to download the meme they created so that they can share it with their friends.

At last, the user has their meme downloaded in their downloads folder with the name of "meme"

I wanted **Meme generator** to be the meme generating webpage that I was searching back in 2015. With this in mind, I hope you will find it as useful as I did.
